HPE-SOS_3.5.0 usage
=======================================================================

1.	Mapping a tape drive to a drive letter

	Before you can access the tape cartridge as a volume, you must first establish a mapping between
	the tape drive and a Windows drive letter. To do this, run the LTFS Configuration Tool located in
	the HPE StoreOpen Software program group.
	
	NOTE: The tool may request administrative privileges, depending on your system security policies.
	
	By default the first usable tape drive found on your system is selected, along with the first unused
	drive letter. Change the selections as desired, then to mount with all the default options, click Create
	mapping. This results in the following actions:
	1.The configuration tool checks that the drive is accessible and usable.
	2.The tool attempts to verify that your system has suitable HBA driver support for LTFS operation.
	3.The tool looks for a currently loaded tape cartridge. If a cartridge is found, it is checked to
	  see if it is formatted as an LTFS volume. If not, you are offered the option of formatting the
	  cartridge before proceeding. It is recommended that you should accept this option.
	4.Once a formatted cartridge is detected, or if no cartridge is present, the file system service is
	  started and the window is updated to reflect the new configuration.
	5.A new option called Drive alias is provided for the user to specify drive names of their choice.
	  
2.	Using HPE StoreOpen Software (Windows)
	
	When the mapping has been established, you can close or minimize the configuration tool,or choose 
	to map to another tape drive.

	NOTE: SOS supports mapping of two tape drives at a time.The newly provided Drive alias option will
		  be useful to provide appropriate drive names for both the drives.
	
	A Windows Explorer window will now include an LTFS volume. The first time you access this drive
	volume there will be a slight delay whilst the index is loaded and checked, but from then on the
	drive volume may be accessed as normal.

	CAUTION: If you insert a cleaning cartridge while a drive letter is assigned to the tape drive,
	HPE StoreOpen will attempt to use the cartridge. This can degrade the life of the cleaning cartridge.
	In order to preserve the cleaning cartridge, remove the drive letter mapping for the tape drive by
	using the LTFS configurator before inserting the cleaning cartridge in to the tape drive.
	
	a. Mount options
	
	In most circumstances the default options are suitable and you do not need to change them. However
	for flexibility you can modify them if you wish. The options are as follows:

	• Mount read-only – If you select this option, the cartridge contents are readable but cannot be
	  modified. This provides a “software” write-protect mechanism; the same effect can be achieved
	  using the “hardware” write protect tab on the tape cartridge.
	• Re-mount the mapped drives at system start-up – The normal behavior is to configure the
	  service so that it automatically restarts when the system boots up. Unselect this checkbox if
	  you do not want this to happen (for example, if this is a temporary setup where the tape drive
	  will be removed after the system is shut down).
	
	b. Advanced options 
	   
	This opens a further window where you can adjust less common options.
	  
	NOTE: Some of these options may have a noticeable impact on performance and in general
	should not be changed.
	   
	◦ Support ticket folder: This is the location where drive logs are stored. These logs are
	  generated on each unmount and whenever an error is detected. The application will keep
	  the ten most recent logs and automatically delete any older logs. These logs may be useful
	  to HPE support personnel but otherwise can be ignored.
	◦ Enable verbose logging: This is not required in normal operation and you should only
	  use it when requested by HPE support personnel, as it will have an adverse effect on performance.
	◦ Enable extended verbose logging: This adds a further level of detail to logfile entries.
	◦ Thumbnails: When Windows encounters a folder full of files, it attempts to build thumbnails
	  to represent the content of each file. This is not desirable in an LTFS volume, because it
	  may take many minutes or even hours to generate the thumbnails. So by default HPE
	  StoreOpen Software tells the operating system that the volume is in the “offline” state,
	  which prevents automatic thumbnail creation. You can turn this off if desired, but be
	  aware that it will have a severe effect on the time needed to open and browse folders.
	• Index capture: This option allows you to keep a copy of the latest index from tape on
	  the local disk. Enable the check box and enter the path to the folder where you would
	  like to keep the index file after the tape is unmounted.
	◦ Index updates: This allows you to control when indexes are written to tape.
	◦ Index partition usage: The LTFS format allows for data files to be written in the index
	  partition, which if used carefully may improve access times for frequently-used files.
	  
	However, in general you should leave this setting in its default state.
	
	c. Index updates
	
	Accessing data stored on tape relies on an up-to-date index being available. HPE StoreOpen
	Software offers three different mechanisms for updating the copy of the index stored on tape.
	The default setting is to write a copy of the index to tape periodically while writing data; the index
	is written every five minutes. You can change the time interval to every minute. This method of
	index update reduces the window of exposure to power-loss events, since there will be an index
	on tape no more than five minutes old (if using the default interval).
	The second option is to write the index to tape only when a volume is removed. In normal operation
	this is sufficient, since the LTFS usage model requires the volume to be unmounted after use, so
	there is always a valid index. However, if power is removed from the drive without unmounting,
	for example, through an unplanned power outage or accidental unplugging, the volume will be
	left in an inconsistent state, and all files added since the last dismount operation will be inaccessible.
	The CheckWizard utility may be able to recover the file data to the _ltfs_lostandfound
	directory, but the metadata (filename, access dates, and so on) will be lost.
	The final mechanism provided in HPE StoreOpen Software is to update the index every time a
	file is closed after writing. This further reduces the exposure window to a single file, or (if several
	processes are using the volume simultaneously) to the number of files being written concurrently.
	However, this does add some overhead, both in terms of the tape capacity used for each index,
	and also in terms of performance since the writing of the index will take bandwidth away from
	writing data. These overhead effects will become more severe with smaller file sizes.
	In most cases the default behavior offers the best solution, but the options allow you to modify the
	behavior for a particular situation.
	
3.	Cartridge utilities

	The cartridge utilities button opens a further window where you can access the utilities for formatting
	the tape, etc
	
	• Load: Physically loads the tape which is already presented to the drive.
	• Unload: Physically ejects the LTFS volume from the tape drive. The file system will continue to
	  run, but attempting to access the volume while no cartridge is present will result in the error
	  message “The device is not ready”. When a formatted LTFS cartridge is loaded into the drive,
	  the index will be read and checked, and then the volume may again be accessed.
	• Format: Starts the FormatWizard to guide you through the steps and options of creating a
	  fresh volume on the current cartridge
	• Unformat: Runs the UnformatWizard to guide you through the steps and options of removing
	  the LTFS format from the tape.
	• Check: Runs the Error-checking tool which scans the volume for consistency and can correct
	  certain problems with the format.
	  
4.	File permissions

	The HPE StoreOpen Software application manages a common set of file permissions for all files
	and users; file and directory ownership is not recorded to tape media. The only permission that is
	tracked is write-protect information.
	
5.	File names

	To maintain compatibility when copying files between multiple platforms, it is strongly recommended
	that do you do not use the following characters LTFS filenames, directory names, or extended
	attributes: * ? < > : " | / \
	
6.	Limitations

	• When the tape cartridge is almost full, further write operations will be prevented. The free
	  space on the tape (for example, as reported by Explorer) will indicate that there is still some
	  capacity available, but that is reserved for updating the index when the tape is unmounted.
	• Future mounts of a cartridge that is almost full (that is, it has passed the point at which “early
	  warning” is reported) will mount as Read Only, to prevent further modifications that may not
	  fit on the tape. This status is cleared when the cartridge is reformatted (using mkltfs) or when
	  the volume is rolled back, erasing the history.
	• MAM and LTFS attributes cannot be listed using the ltfsattr command. The ltfs and MAM
	  attributes are case sensitive.
	• LTFS volume name cannot be modified on a LTFS tape which is full.
	• Disconnecting or powering off a tape drive while it is mounted can make the LTFS volume
	  inconsistent. Always un-mount the LTFS volume before disconnecting or powering down the
	  tape drive.
	  
7.	Working with Windows Explorer

	Once the mapping has been established and an LTFS-formatted cartridge loaded, you can access
	the contents of the cartridge either at a command prompt or through Windows Explorer.
	LTFS Configurator now also displays messages indicating the progress of the mount operation.
	
    i) The volume type is shown as a LTFS VOLUME. This results from the way that the LTFS 
	   volume is linked into the operating system, and has no impact on operation.
       ii) The Total size and Space free figures appear slightly lower than expected; this is due 
       to the way that Windows calculates and report capacities in binary GB (230 bytes) and TB 
       (240 bytes) instead of decimal GB (109 bytes) and TB (1012) bytes. Note too that these are
       worst-case figures; if the volume is employing the drive’s default lossless hardware data
       compression, then the actual capacity available may be significantly greater than that 
       shown.

8.	Using the FormatWizard

	Before you can use an LTO-5 or LTO-6 cartridge with LTFS, it must be prepared by formatting
	according to the LTFS specification. The LTFSFormatWizard application helps to select appropriate
	options and settings and then formats the tape. You can run it from the context menu, from the LTFS
	Tools tab in the drive properties, or from the HPE StoreOpen Software program group.

	CAUTION: Read all the text on the wizard dialog windows carefully. Completing this wizard
	will irretrievably destroy all tape contents.
	
	NOTE: If you execute the FormatWizard while no LTFS volume is mapped to a drive letter, the
	wizard may require administrative privileges (depending on system security policies and settings).
	Running with insufficient privileges will result in an inability to “see” the tape drive and consequently
	no formatting can be performed. If this occurs, right-click on the executable and select Run as
	administrator.	   
	
	a) The initial screen presents information about the operation that has been started.
	b) The next window allows you to select a tape drive and related options.

	The first drive on the system (or the one being used by the mounted file system, if any) will be
	selected by default; change the selection to use a different tape drive.
	NOTE: Only drives suitable for use with LTFS are shown in the list.
	By default the drive’s lossless hardware data compression engine will be enabled. You can
	turn it off if desired, in which case all writes and reads to this cartridge will bypass the
	compression engine.
	
	c) The next window contains options related to the cartridge format.
	Both of these fields are optional, and are intended to provide a method of identifying the
	cartridge. Tape serial number should be no more than six alphanumeric characters (A–Z,
	0–9). Volume name is a free-format text string.
	The Advanced button leads to a further set of options; however it is recommended that you
	leave these at their default settings for all normal usage.
	d) The final window summarizes the format operation that you have defined using the wizard.
	
	When you click Finish, the following operations take place:
	i)  If the cartridge is currently mounted, it is unmounted
	ii) A “Progress” dialog window is created.
	iii)The format operation starts.
	iv) All tape contents are removed and a fresh (empty) index written to the cartridge.
	v) 	If the cartridge was mounted, the new cartridge is mounted.
	vi) When the Progress dialog shows that the format is complete, you can close the window.  
	
9.	Using the CheckWizard

	The LTFSCheckWizard application has two purposes:
	• To check for problems with the format as written on the cartridge, and usually recover from
	them. This is not normally necessary but may be required for example if the drive was powered
	off without cleanly unmounting the volume.
	• To facilitate the rolling back of the cartridge contents to an earlier state.
	
	CAUTION: Read all the text on the wizard dialog windows carefully. Completing this wizard
	may irretrievably modify the tape contents.
	
	NOTE: If you execute the CheckWizard while no LTFS volume is mapped to a drive letter, the
	wizard may require administrative privileges (depending on system security policies and settings).
	Running with insufficient privileges will result in an inability to “see” the tape drive and consequently
	no checking can be performed. If this occurs, right-click on the executable and select Run as
	administrator.
	
	a) The initial screen presents information about the operation that has been started.
	b) The next window allows you to select a tape drive.
	The first drive on the system (or the one being used by the mounted file system, if any) is
	selected by default; change the selection to use a different tape drive.
	
	NOTE: Only drives suitable for use with LTFS are shown in the list.
	Select Provide detailed progress information to display more detail during the checking
	operation.
	c) The next window is where you select the desired mode of operation
	
	• Check and repair volume: Select this option to check the volume for consistency.
	
	If you suspect the volume was not updated properly due to a power outage, select
	the Perform deep recovery if necessary option, which will attempt to verify and, if
	necessary, recover from a missing End Of Data (EOD) marker. This may take a long
	time and may result in the loss of unindexed data blocks written since the last good
	index.

	If it is important to try to recover those unindexed data blocks, select the option
	Attempt to save any unindexed data blocks. The utility will try to save the blocks to
	a new folder _ltfs_lostandfound.
	
	NOTE: You need to identify and manipulate any recovered blocks manually, since
	there will be no identifying details (because they were not in any index).

	• Rollback cartridge contents to previous state: Select this option if you want to change the
	view of the cartridge contents to a previous point in time. There are two choices:

	Keep all history to allow potential roll forward in the future: The default is to roll
	back the contents as viewed in the index, but not erase any data — on other words,
	the view of the contents is changed, but the actual contents are unchanged. This
	allows for a future operation to “roll forward” the contents again, recovering changes
	that occurred since the rollback point. Note that no storage space is freed up by this
	option.
	
	Permanently erase all files after rollback point: Roll back and erase the history. In
	this case, any changes since the rollback point will be lost irretrievably, so be sure
	that this is what you intend. This option will free up the storage space used by those
	changes.
	
	If you opt to Rollback cartridge contents, an additional window is presented where you
	will be able to select a rollback point from those on the cartridge. Click Start scan to
	initiate a scan of the entire volume, looking for previous index points stored on tape. This
	operation may take many minutes or even several hours. When complete, the window
	is refreshed to show the available rollback points.
	
	d) Select a rollback point and click Next.A summary of the operation to be carried out is displayed.
	
	When you click Finish, the following operations take place:
	i)  If the cartridge is currently mounted, it is unmounted.
	ii) A Progress dialog window is created.
	iii)The check or rollback operation starts.
	iv) The Progress dialog is updated as the operation proceeds to completion.
	v) 	If the cartridge was mounted, the checked or updated volume will be re-mounted
	
	e) When the Progress dialog shows that the operation is complete, you can close the window.
	
10. Using the UnformatWizard

	CAUTION: This operation will permanently remove all data present on the cartridge, so only use
	it if this is what you intend.
	You do not normally need to use the UnformatWizard. Its purpose is to remove the LTFS format
	from a cartridge and return it to a single partition, so that the cartridge can be used with a different
	software application. This utility is similar to the FormatWizard, but is much simpler, since there is
	only one option affecting operation (to eject the cartridge from the drive once the format has been
	removed).
	NOTE: The UnformatWizard may request administrative privileges to execute (depending on
	system security policies and settings).
	
11. Using the ltfsattr utility

	HPE StoreOpen Software version 2.2.0 onwards includes the LTFSATTR utility which can be used
	to access the attributes from the LTFS volume. It is a Windows command line utility which provides
	similar functionality to the “attr” command in Linux and the “xattr” command in Mac OS X.
	
	Running the ltfsattr utility with no parameters gives the usage information.
	
	Usage:  ltfsattr -h
			ltfsattr -p attrname [-v] filename
			ltfsattr -w attrname attrvalue [-v] filename
			ltfsattr -l [-v] filename
			ltfsattr -x attrname [-v] filename
			
	ltfsattr options:
			-h prints the usage information
			
			-p reads and displays the value of attrname
			for filename with -v, also displays the
			filename and the attribute name
			
			-w writes attribute attrname with value
			attrvalue for filename with -v, provides
			confirmation (otherwise silent on success)
			
			-l lists the user attributes for filename with -v, 
			also lists the values (otherwise just the names)

			-x deletes attribute attrname for filename
			with -v, provides confirmation (otherwise
			silent on success)

	NOTE: Filename may also refer to a directory or folder name.
	NOTE: This utility manipulates extended attributes in conjunction with HPE StoreOpen software
	and should only be used in that context with a mounted LTFS volume.
	
12. HPE StoreOpen Cartridge Browser 

	HPE StoreOpen Software version 2.2.0 onwards includes a Windows GUI utility to view the
	contents of LTFS index files. Users can select a folder which contains LTFS index files and 
	the utility will list all the index files in that folder. The user can then open a detailed 
	view displaying the contents of any index file.

	NOTE: This utility does not interact with the tape drive or the StoreOpen software. Instead, it is
	an independent tool for viewing the stored LTFS index files which are generated when an LTFS
	volume is mounted and unmounted.
	
	Users can select a folder where the index files are kept (in most setups this will be the directory
	path selected for the ‘index capture’ setting in the advanced options of the HPE LTFS configuration
	GUI). The Cartridge Browser utility then displays all the index files in the folder. When you hover
	the mouse over a particular index file the details about the index will be shown.
	If you double click on any of the index files, the utility will open another window which shows a
	detailed view of the selected index as a nested expandable tree. Selecting a particular file shows
	the information regarding that file.
	
	User can also search for specific files and find out in which index that file is present. The search
	feature will be very useful if you have a lot of indexes and want to find out which tape has the 
	particular file. The search box accepts regular expressions as described below:
	
	c matches any literal character c
	. matches any single character
	^ matches the beginning of the input string
	$ matches the end of the input string
	* matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character
	
13. LTFS Smart Copy utility
	A console is provided with the set up to run the LTFS SmartCopy utility in windows
	
	The installer includes the LTFS Smart Copy utility for Windows.

	The LTFS Smart Copy tool provides the binary ltfscopy command that provides the below two 
	benefits to the LTFS users:
	
	- Faster data transfer from Tape to disk and Tape to Tape.
	- File verification using hash values.

	The ltfscopy tool is installed by default when you install HPE StoreOpen Software. The
	executable name is ltfscopy.exe and it will be available in the installation folder where you
	installed the HPE StoreOpen Software software.

	Command examples:

	To copy the files from the tape cartridge to C:\photos:
	ltfscopy.exe –s E:\CVG427L5\ -d C:\photos
	To copy files and all subfolders and files recursively:
	ltfscopy.exe –s E:\CVG427L5\ -d C:\photos --recursive
	To copy files and all subfolders and files recursively and verify:
	ltfscopy.exe –s E:\CVG427L5\ -d C:\photos --copy --verify --recursive
	To verify previously copied data by comparing it with source:
	ltfscopy.exe -s E:\CVG427L5\ -d C:\photos --verify –recursive
	
	Run 'ltfscopy --help' for more information about usage and the supported options.
	
14. LTFS tape library utility

	The ltfslibutil tool is installed when you install HPE StoreOpen Software.
	It can be used to exchange cartridges for a mounted LTFS volume in a 
	supported tape library.  Open the LTFS Console from the Start Menu and run
	ltfslibutil –h for usage information.

	Command examples:

	To identify which cartridge is currently loaded in drive R:
	ltfslibutil –i R:

	To list available cartridges in the library:
	ltfslibutil –l –n R:

	To unload the current cartridge and replace with barcode G80289L7:
	ltfslibutil –b G80289L7 R:

	  VEA names used in previous release of LTFS become obsolete and
	  no longer available.
	- See Important Note below
	- Enhanced the ability to recover the tapes in inconsistent state,
	  which was caused by unexpected power outage.
	- Added a new function to flush the in-memory user data to the tape medium
	  at pre-defined timing; either sync at file close or sync periodically.
	  The default behaviour is now to sync the index every five minutes.
	- Changed the command line syntax of ltfs and mkltfs command for
	  specifying the data placement rules
	- Check for incompatible media and report problems in a helpful way
	- Various minor corrections and updates


Important Note:
===============

Earlier versions of the HPE LTFS application supported the original 1.0 LTFS
format specification; version v1.2.0 and later supports the updated 2.0.0 LTFS
format specification.  LTFS volumes created with application v1.2.0 will not
be readable in older versions of the LTFS application, as shown in the
following table:

                      Cartridge written by    Cartridge written by    Cartridge written by
LTFS application       v1.1.0 or earlier       v1.2.0 or later         v2.1.0 or later
--------------------  ----------------------  ----------------------  -----------------------
v1.1.0 or earlier       Read/Write ok           Cannot be mounted       N/A

                        automatically be 
                        converted to new
                        format if written

                        automatically be        automatically be 
                        converted to new        converted to new
                        format if written       format if written

HPE recommends that all instances of HPE LTFS should be updated to latest version
to avoid these compatibility issues. 

If for some reason it is important to maintain cartridges readable by
previous versions of the HPE LTFS application, care should be taken to avoid
writing to those cartridges with the new version of the application.  This
may be accomplished by mounting the volume as read-only, or by using the
cartridge write-protect tab to prevent cartridge updates.  However this
should be regarded as a temporary measure until all the application instances
can be updated to latest version.


Limitations:
============

	1.	When the tape cartridge is almost full, further write operations will
		be prevented.  The free space on the tape (e.g. from the df command)
		will indicate that there is still some capacity available, but that
		is reserved for updating the index when the tape is unmounted.

	2.	Future mounts of a cartridge that is almost full (has passed the
		point at which "early warning" is reported) will mount as Read Only,
		to prevent further modifications which may not fit on tape.  This 
		status is cleared when a cartridge is reformatted (using mkltfs) or
		when the volume is rolled back erasing history (using ltfsck).

	3.	(Mac OS X)  LTFS does not support moving a folder within LTFS.
		Any attempt to move a folder in such a manner will result in an 
		"operation not permitted" error, and the operation will be ignored.
		The user can still move a file within LTFS, and the user can also move
		a folder from LTFS to non-LTFS file system or vice versa.

	4.	(Mac OS X)  Mac OS X's Spotlight will not display the files 
		on LTFS as a result of search.
