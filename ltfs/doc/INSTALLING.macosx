=======================================================================
Installing on Mac OS X systems
=======================================================================

1.	Before starting to install and use LTFS, you must ensure that the 
        OSXFUSE module is present and loaded.
	Refer to HPE Data Agile BURA Compatibility Matrix
          www.hpe.com/storage/BURACompatibility  for OSXFUSE version information 

	If the module is not present on your system, you must first 
	install it from the included package or from another source. 

2.	Determine whether you want to use the pre-compiled package or build
	your own version of the LTFS application.

	To build your own, download and unpack the file HPELTFS_SOURCE.tar.gz
	then follow the instructions in ltfs/doc/BUILDING.macosx

3.	To use pre-compiled binaries, download the file:
	HPEStoreOpenSoftware.dmg

4.	Install the ICU package first by double-clicking on the file
	ICUFramework.pkg and following the instructions.

5.	Now install the LTFS package by double-clicking on the file
	HPE StoreOpen Software.pkg and following the instructions.

7.	LTFS is now installed on your system and is ready to use.
	The README file contains details of how to use LTFS on the command
	line in a terminal window.  The installation package also places an
	"HPE StoreOpen Software" console application in your Applications 
	folder which can be used to simplify the tasks of preparing, formatting
	and mounting an LTFS volume.

8.	If at a later date you want to uninstall LTFS from your system,
	delete /usr/local/bin/*ltfs* and then delete the tree under
	/Library/Frameworks/LTFS.framework

	The console application can be uninstalled by dragging it to the Trash.

	Execute the command:
	pkgutil --forget com.hpe.ltfs
	to cause the Package Manager subsystem to remove references to LTFS.

	To also delete the ICU package, delete the tree under
	/Library/Frameworks/ICU.framework
