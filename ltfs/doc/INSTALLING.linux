Installing on Linux systems
=======================================================================
1.	The below mentioned dependencies are required by HPE SOS to run
	on supported Linux systems. These dependencies can be either
	installed from their RPM packages or can be installed by compiling
	the source. The dependency packages are not supplied with HPE SOS;
        users will need to download from their respective web sites and
        install them.
	
		a. FUSE 2.8.5 or higher (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/)
		b. ICU v50.1.2 (http://site.icu-project.org/download)
		c. libxml2 v2.7 or higher
		d. e2fsprogs 1.41 or higher
		
2.	Before starting to install and use HPE-SOS, you must ensure that the
	FUSE kernel module is present and loaded.

	To check, execute the following command:
	  lsmod | grep fuse

	If the module is not currently loaded, you can load it as follows:
	  modprobe fuse

	If the module is not present on your system, you must first obtain
	and install it.  Details of how to do this are beyond the scope of
	this document; refer to http://fuse.sourceforge.net/ for further
	information.

3.	Determine whether you want to use pre-compiled binaries or build
	your own version of the LTFS application.  

	To build your own, download and unpack the file HPELTFS_SOURCE.tar.gz
	then follow the instructions in ltfs/doc/BUILDING.linux

4.	Download the file for your operating system platform:

	(RHEL 6.x (x86 and x64) and RHEL 7.x (x64))
	HPE-SOS_3.5.0_RHEL_x86_PKG.tar.gz	 (for x86 32-bit installations)
	HPE-SOS_3.5.0_RHEL_x64_PKG.tar.gz	 (for x64 64-bit installations) 
	
5.	Unzip the package to extract the binaries for supported architectures:
	For example:
	  tar -zxvf HPE-SOS_3.5.0_RHEL_x64_PKG.tar.gz
	
	This will unpack the following files in the current directory:
		a. hpe-sos-3.5.0-71.x86_64.rpm
		b. INSTALLING.linux
		c. COPYING.LIB
		d. README
	
6.	Install the hpe-sos-3.5-71.x86_64.rpm
	For example:
	  rpm -ivh hpe-sos-3.5-71.x86_64.rpm
	
        NOTE: If the dependencies are not yet installed, you can still install
        HPE SOS using the command 
          rpm -ivh hpe-sos-3.5-71.x86_64.rpm --nodeps
	        
	The executables (ltfs, mkltfs, ltfsck, unltfs, ltfscopy) are placed in
	/usr/local/bin/, a number of dynamic libraries in /usr/local/lib64/,
	and also in a new subdirectory /usr/local/lib64/ltfs/
	
7.	That's it!  Refer to the README file for details of how 
	to use LTFS.

8.	If at a later date you want to uninstall LTFS from your system, run
        the command
   	  rpm -e hpe-sos
