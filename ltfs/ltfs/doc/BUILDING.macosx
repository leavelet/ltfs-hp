Building HPE-SOS from source code (Mac OS X)
=======================================================================

1. Unpack the archive source file to a suitable location:

   $ gunzip HPE-SOS_SOURCE.tar.gz
   $ tar xf HPE-SOS_SOURCE.tar

2. Ensure that the following packages have been installed:
   Apple Developer Tools
   macFUSE (Refer to HPE Data Agile BURA Compatibility Matrix
                 at www.hpe.com/storage/BURACompatibility 
                 for OSXFUSE version information) 
    ICU 50.1.2

3. Run the LTFS build script:

   $ cd hpe-sos_3.5.0
   $ ./build_osx_package.sh

   If no errors are reported then the build was successful.

   Do not use the configure script or Makefile; these are intended for
   use on Linux platforms. The supplied build_osx_package.sh script
   performs the steps needed to build on the Mac OS X platform.

4. The build process produces an installable package in the directory
   hpe-sos_3.5.0/distribution/

   Open that directory in Finder and select the HPE_ltfs.pkg

   The installation files will be copied to the directory
   /Library/Frameworks/LTFS.framework/Versions/Current/
   and symbolic links for the executables (mkltfs, ltfs, ltfsck, unltfs)
   are created in /usr/local/bin/

5. That's it! Refer to the README file for details of how to use LTFS.

6. To uninstall LTFS, you need to delete the symbolic links in
   /usr/local/bin/ for the executables (mkltfs, ltfs, ltfsck, unltfs)
   and then delete the directory /Library/Frameworks/LTFS.framework

   Execute the command:
   pkgutil --forget com.hpe.ltfs
   to cause the Package Manager subsystem to remove references to LTFS.
